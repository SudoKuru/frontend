    "If you recall from a previous lesson hidden singles are based on the fact that if a row, column, or box only has a single location to place a value than it must be placed there. This idea can be generalized to any set size.",

    "For instance, you can have hidden pairs, triplets, and quadruplets. All hidden sets rely on there only being x places that x values can be placed in a given row, column, or box leading to each of them having to be placed in one of them eventually. This results in all other notes being removed from them.",

    "Above we have highlighted a hidden triplet made up of 1, 5, and 9. They are a hidden triplet because they are three cells containing a combined three numbers that are absent from every other cell in their shared column (other cells are highlighted in gold).",

    "Therefore, each of them will eventually be filled with one of those three numbers. This lets you remove every other number from their notes as highlighted in red.",

    "You've now learned how to use the hidden set strategies! While you can't directly place values with hidden sets you can remove lots of notes which lead to placing values like in the case of the 1 naked single revealed in the column by the hidden triplet we just applied.",
