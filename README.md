## Sudokuru is an open-source project focused on developing a world-class, cross-platform Sudoku app. We aim to provide a delightful user experience while also contributing to the community by building a collection of reusable software modules. These modules are designed to be free, well-documented, modern, and interoperable, allowing developers to easily incorporate them into their own Sudoku-related projects.

### This frontend module is the primary user interface for Sudokuru, providing a cross-platform Sudoku experience built with React Native Web and TypeScript. It offers a clean, intuitive design with features such as:

- Ability to play Sudoku across 9 different difficulty levels generated by the Sudokuru Clearinghouse module which ingests raw puzzle strings, generates data about them, inserts them into a Postgres database, and provides a way to access the database directly or to export data from it directly into a TypeScript array.
- Lessons to learn how to play Sudoku from the basics all the way to advanced strategies
- Statistics to track your progress
- Various preferences including ones to customize dynamic board highlighting
- _Upcoming_: custom strategy based hints from the Sudokuru npm library module
- _Upcoming_: drills which let you practice individual strategies also powered by the Sudokuru npm library module

# üõ†Ô∏è Local development

## General Setup:

1. Git clone this repository
2. Install nodejs `v19.5.0` or later
3. Install npm `9.3.1` or later
4. Run `npm i` in this repositories root folder

## Mobile Setup (not needed to run website):

1. Contact Thomas to get added to the Expo organization so that you can log in with your own email and password.
2. Download the expo app on your mobile device.
3. On your development device e.g. laptop login by running: `expo login` and fill out the parameters.

## Running the Application Locally

1. Run `npm run start` from this repositories root folder
2. For iOS, scan the QR code with your camera app, for Android you will need to scan the code from within the Expo app.
3. For Web, hit the w key to start up the website at `localhost:19000`

# Only use single puzzle for debugging

In the `app/Api/Puzzles.ts` file, the `startGame` function can be modified so that only a single game is used.
Replace `returnGameOfDifficulty(difficulty)` with `returnGameOfDifficulty("dev")` and the dev puzzle will be retrieved.
The `returnGameOfDifficulty` function can also be modified to return a desired puzzle. By default it returns the first `novice` puzzle.

# EAS Update

[EAS Update Description](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/how-it-works/)

To make use of EAS update, run following commands:

1. `npm i -g eas-cli`

2. `npx expo install expo-updates`

3. `eas update --branch [branch] --message [message]` or `eas update --auto` (--auto will get message from latest commit and branch from current branch)

# Run Snyk scans

The command to run a Snyk Open Source scan is `npm run snyk:opensource`

The command to run a Snyk code scan is `npm run snyk:code`

Existing issues in main branch can be [viewed here](https://app.snyk.io/org/sudokuru)

# Run Playwright E2E Tests

## Setup

- run `npx playwright install` to install playwright dependencies
- create a `.env` file in for local development based on values in `.env.example`

## Run Tests

- make sure that the website is running locally (or change baseURL to match where you want to test)
- run `npm run playwright:ui` to run tests using playwright ui
- run `npm run playwright:test` to run tests using playwright cli
- run `npm run playwright:report` to view playwright report

# Run Code Coverage and Cypress E2E tests

Run `npm run web:dev`  
This starts the website in development mode, with access to the development plugins.  
Run `npm run open:cypress` or `npx cypress open` to open up the cypress testing interface.  
**Note: Running individual spec files will override the code coverage of the previous spec file**  
To generate a code-coverage report for all spec files, run the command `npx cypress run`. This will run all of the tests at the same time and output a combined code-coverage report at the end.  
To disable screenshots and video for cypress tests run `npm run test:cypress`  
After running tests, `.nyc_output` and `coverage` folders are generated. The coverage folder contains all of the code coverage results from the tests.  
More information can be found at [cypress docs](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage).  
The best way to view coverage results locally is to open the `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` file.

# Deployments

### Preview Branch

In order to deploy your local branch in preview mode, run the following command:  
`npm run preview:vercel`  
You will need to log in with our team email account.  
The console will output a preview url for viewing.

Preview mode can be run on any branch to preview how the site will look on Vercel.  
It is encouraged to use preview mode before merging changes into main.

### Preview PR

PR Previews can be viewed from the bot comment at the bottom of the PR.
PR Previews can also be viewed in the `Publish Preview` task of the `app_preview` job.  
The website link allows you to add comments directly to the webpage!
