## Sudokuru is an open-source project focused on developing a world-class, cross-platform Sudoku app. We aim to provide a delightful user experience while also contributing to the community by building a collection of reusable software modules. These modules are designed to be free, well-documented, modern, and interoperable, allowing developers to easily incorporate them into their own Sudoku-related projects.

### This frontend module is the primary user interface for Sudokuru, providing a cross-platform Sudoku experience built with React Native Web and TypeScript. It offers a clean, intuitive design with features such as:

- 🎮 Play Sudoku across 9 different difficulty levels generated by the Sudokuru Clearinghouse module
- 🎓 Learn how to play Sudoku with lessons from the basics all the way to advanced strategies
- 📊 Statistics to track your progress
- ⚙️ Various preferences including ones to customize dynamic board highlighting
- 📅 _Upcoming_: custom strategy based hints from the Sudokuru npm library module
- 📅 _Upcoming_: drills which let you practice individual strategies also powered by the Sudokuru npm library module

### 🚢 Tier 1 Support - We have full end to end test coverage for all new and existing functionality. We do manual testing of new features before deployment.

### ⚒️ Tier 2 Support - We have partial or zero end to end test coverage for new and existing functionality. We may not always do manual testing of new features before deployment.

### 📅 Planned Support - We do not currently support this platform, but we plan on supporting in the future.

# 🛠️ Local development

## ⚙️ General Setup:

1. Git clone this repository
2. Install Node.js `v19.5.0` or later
3. Install npm `9.3.1` or later
4. Run `npm i` in the root folder

## 📲 Mobile Setup (not needed to run website):

1. Contact Thomas to get added to the Expo organization so that you can log in with your own email and password.
2. Download the expo app on your mobile device.
3. On your development device, e.g., laptop, login by running: `expo login` and fill out the parameters.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application Locally

1. Run `npm run start` from this repositories root folder
2. For iOS, scan the QR code with your camera app, for Android you will need to scan the code from within the Expo app.
3. For Web, hit the w key to start up the website at `localhost:19000`

## ✅ Playwright E2E Tests

### ⚙️ Setup

1. Run `npx playwright install` to install playwright dependencies
2. Create a `.env` file in for local development based on values in `.env.example`

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Tests

- ⚠️ Make sure that the website is running locally (or change baseURL to match where you want to test)
- 💻 Run `npm run playwright:ui` to run tests using playwright ui
- ⌨️ Run `npm run playwright:test` to run tests using playwright cli
- 📋 Run `npm run playwright:report` to view playwright report

### 🔧 Setup to use a Single Puzzle for Debugging

- In the `app/Api/Puzzles.ts` file, the `startGame` function can be modified so that only a single game is used.
- Replace `returnGameOfDifficulty(difficulty)` with `returnGameOfDifficulty("dev")` and the dev puzzle will be retrieved.
- The `returnGameOfDifficulty` function can also be modified to return a desired puzzle. By default, it returns the first `novice` puzzle.

### ⚠️ Cypress E2E Tests ⚠️ (We are phasing out Cypress Tests)

Run `npm run web:dev`  
This starts the website in development mode, with access to the development plugins.  
Run `npm run open:cypress` or `npx cypress open` to open up the cypress testing interface.  
**Note: Running individual spec files will override the code coverage of the previous spec file**  
To generate a code-coverage report for all spec files, run the command `npx cypress run`. This will run all of the tests at the same time and output a combined code-coverage report at the end.  
To disable screenshots and video for cypress tests run `npm run test:cypress`  
After running tests, `.nyc_output` and `coverage` folders are generated. The coverage folder contains all of the code coverage results from the tests.  
More information can be found at [cypress docs](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage).  
The best way to view coverage results locally is to open the `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` file.

## 🛡️🐶 Run Snyk scans

The command to run a Snyk Open Source scan is `npm run snyk:opensource`

The command to run a Snyk code scan is `npm run snyk:code`

# 🛣️ Roadmap

## Github Project Kanban Boards

We organize our future work using the [Frontend Github Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Sudokuru/projects/4/views/1) which we currently have divided into the following six subboards. Each individual ticket starts as a draft with just a few words describing the issue and becomes an issue after we have, at a minimum, added clear agreed upon acceptance criteria.

### 💡 Backlog

This is the general bucket for everything that we are considering doing someday but does not fit into any of the following boards.

### ⚠️ Tech Debt

This is for where we've taken short cuts during development and have to go back and make improvements, e.g., fixing old SonarCloud issues.

### ❌ Bugs

This is for where things are working as intended.

### 🚀 Official Web Release

This is our current milestone we are working towards where we will move to a permanent URL after getting the website ready for end user traffic. After this is completed, we plan on replacing it with an Android App Store Release and then iOS App Store Release boards.

### ⚙️ In development

This is for all the tickets we are currently working.

### 🚢 Shipped

This is for all the cool things we have already accomplished!
